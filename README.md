When attemping to make changes to the main branch, first grab the latest version of develop. Make a branch off of that version with the title of the change you'd like to make. Once you have made all the changes you want to, create a Pull Request with those changes for review. Once approved feel free to merge to Develop.

When attempting to test your changes locally, pull the latest version of develop and run the local branch you created locally to see your changes.
